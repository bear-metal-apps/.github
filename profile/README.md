## About Us

Bear Metal is a high school robotics team based in Maple Valley, WA, competing in the First Robotics Competition. Our subteam, Apps, focuses on creating software to support strategy, scouting, and team operations. Each year we work to better our team along with adapting our apps for further use outside of our team. We have and will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that our apps can be used by all, even those with less resources finiacally, and with a overall lower number of members.
